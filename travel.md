# Travel Policy

1. A travel budget will be approved by Motion of the Board before travel is undertaken.

2. Disclosure of travel expenses on the website will occur in conjunction with bi-annual financial reports, and will include the total expenses to date in the travel budget line, and a list of the events attended for the period. There was concern about being too transparent (itemizing costs of attending each event) might solicit backlash from persons looking to accuse the group of being partisan (ie, spending more to attend events of one party than another over the year).

3. Meal per diem of $45/day (split as $10 for breakfast, $10 for lunch, $25 for dinner), including gratuities and taxes. Meals covered under conference/event fees will not be covered by per diem.

4. Use of private automobile: mileage will be reimbursed at the current Federal Government approved rate (currently $0.54/km, $0.48/km over 5000km). Group will see how this works the first year, and then determine if annual limits should be imposed for individual travel (eg, U of C currently has a limit of $2400 for term of office).

5. Airfare (although unlikely to be necessary, but should be included just in case) will be economy fare, with change/cancellation fees, baggage fees, and seat selection fees covered.

6. Vehicle rentals will be for compact, mid-size, or full-size vehicles as need requires. Costs will include rental fees, fuel charges, kilometer charges, and insurance coverage.

7. Ground transport will be bus when possible, if not then taxi. No limos or private car service unless objectively and demonstratively cheaper than a taxi. 

8. Parking will be the actual cost of parking and will require a receipt.

9. Registration fees for events or conferences will be the actual cost of the event or conference.

10. Incidentals per diem of $5.00 per day of travel (no receipts necessary) to cover unanticipated costs, and things like metered parking where receipts are not available.
