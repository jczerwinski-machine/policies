   2. When engaging in Board deliberation and voting on motions, Directors are always representing the best interests of the Society and ALL members, and are not speaking for or representing the interest of individual members.

   3. Although appointed by Members of the Society, once appointed, Directors represent the interests of the Society.  Directors shall not be directed to act on behalf of the Society by the appointing member.
